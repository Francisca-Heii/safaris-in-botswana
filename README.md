# Safaris in Botswana
---

 Safaris in Botswana is a website designed for tourists and individuals who want to visit safaris in Botswana to view a variety of wildlife in their natural habitat, take part in adventurous outdoor activities and discover the real Africa. Botswana is a land of sweeping spaces where wetlands thrive and wildlife abounds. Venture into two of the country’s most treasured wilderness areas to discover an astounding array of flora and fauna on a variety of excursions.

 In the northern corner of Botswana near Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe border is the Chobe National Park. The home to one of the world’s largest concentrations of elephants, observe wildlife such as elephants, lions, and wild dogs on game drives and river cruises,  with the Chobe River running through the heart of the park. It is a great place to spot the wildlife.

 Then experience the World Heritage-listed Okavango Delta from two different perspectives: on safari in a remote private concession and exploring the lush heart of the delta by dugout canoe and boat.
